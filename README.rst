What's here
------------
Some things to make my life and my cod(e/ing) better/faster/easier. These are primarily decorators at this point,  but also a variety of scripts and a bit of skeleton/template-y code,  along with some tests.  Future plans and incomplete things are noted below (and in more detail in the issues.)

Some wheel reinvention here,  definitely,  but if one does not reinvent the wheel a few times,  won't one have a poorer understanding of how wheels work?.... 

Future plans
------------
Blah blah future plans blah brief.

Documentation 
-------------
Sphinx documentation is here (filename. html) and in the wiki.  Also in the wiki - blah blah test documentation blah.
